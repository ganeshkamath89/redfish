==============================================================================
Redfish is a distributed filesystem built with the needs of Hadoop in mind.

See https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish for the most up-to-date
information about Redfish.

Requirements

I have forked this project from https://github.com/cmccabe/redfish. I am modifying it as it seems to be 6~7 years old at this time.
